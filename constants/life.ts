<br><h3>9. Confidential &amp; Anonymous Whistle blowing</h3><br>The Company wishes to assure the safety of whistle blowing, and therefore provides whistle blowers with the option of either confidential whistle blowing or anonymous whistle blowing.
<br>9.1 Confidential Whistle blowing<br><br>A whistle blower is encouraged to reveal his or her identity when a report or disclosure is made using any of the channels mentioned above. This approach helps the investigation significantly, as the Whistle blower can be contacted to provide further details on the report, where necessary.
<br>9.2 Anonymous Whistle blowing<br><br>However, a whistle blower may choose not to reveal his or her identity upon making a report. With the reporter's anonymity thus assured, the identity of the reporter cannot be ascertained by anyone. Should this approach be chosen, the Whistle blower must ensure that enough information is provided to enable a thorough investigation.
<br>Whistle blowers should endeavour not to discuss the details of the reported misconduct with other persons, except as part of the investigation to ensure the protection of all parties involved and not to jeopardise the investigation process.</span></p><p><span style="white-space-collapse: preserve;"><br><h3>10. Whistle blower Protection</h3><br>10.1 An employee making a Whistle blowing Report in good faith may do so without fear of retaliation or occupational prejudice. However, this protection is forfeited if it is found that the report was deliberately falsified or made with malicious intent.

<br><h3>11.

<br><h3>13. How to Raise Concerns</h3><br>13.1 As a first step, business-as-usual activities could be taken up with line managers or superiors. This however depends on the seriousness and sensitivity of the issues involved and who is thought to be involved in the malpractice. For example, if it is believed that Management is involved, the Internal Audit Team or Human Resources should be approached.
<br>13.2 Concerns are better raised in writing but if the whistle blower does not feel comfortable to put his or her concern in writing, the Internal Auditor or any other designated officer as may be applicable may at his/her discretion decide to receive a complaint made by telephone or in person at a meeting. Written concerns should set out the background and history of the concern, giving names, dates and places (if known). In order to ensure the confidentiality of any expression of concern it is suggested that Whistle Blowers send their letter/written note in a sealed envelope addressed to the Internal Auditor and clearly marked as "Strictly Private and Confidential - To be opened by addressee only."
